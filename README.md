## Usage

Download source classes and add them into your project 

Make sure to use a subclass of `ScrollHideNavigationController` for your `UINavigationController`. Either set the class of your `UINavigationController` in your storyboard, or create programmatically a `ScrollingNavigationController` instance in your code.


#### Objective-C

```objc

#import "ScrollHideNavigationController.h"

- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];

    [(ScrollingNavigationController *)self.navigationController followScrollView:self.tableView];
}
```

you can put a delay 

```objc
- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];

    [(ScrollingNavigationController *)self.navigationController followScrollView:self.tableView delay:50.0f];
}
```


stop follow view

```objc
 [((ScrollHideNavigationController *)self.navigationController) stopFollowingScrollView];
```
